# Wine_Quality_Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to indicate which features of wine are the most important in determining the quality of wine. Using a machine learning model, we aim to convey what it takes to create the highest-quality, most successful, and most marketable wine.

## Analysis
### Machine Learning Models
Please see DNN_Classification_WineQuality_Red_Hyper_Tuning.ipynb and DNN_Classification_WineQuality_White_Hyper_Tuning.ipynb for our Deep Learning Neural Network machine learning models on both red and white wines, respectively.

### Pre-Processing
Please see the various files in Resources/Preprocessing for our initial pre-processing and data cleanup.

## Questions We Seek to Answer
We maintain a handful of questions we seek to answer once our analysis is thoroughly complete.

- Which features are most important in indicating quality of wine?
- What is our goal for our machine learning model's accuracy on the test data? If we can't reach this goal, what is the highest accuracy we can achieve?
- Which features do not play an important role in wine quality scoring?
- What model is best at predicting outcomes?
- *Why* is the model that is *best* at predicting outcomes the best at doing so?
