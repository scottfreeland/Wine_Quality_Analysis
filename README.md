# Wine_Quality_Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to indicate which features of wine are the most important in determining the quality of any given wine. Using a machine learning model, we aim to convey what it takes to create the highest-quality, most successful, and most marketable wine.

## Communication Protocol
All three members of this team correspond daily via Slack messaging. Every other day, the team members meet by Zoom video calls. In these calls, four points of communication are touched upon. 

First, we explain to one another our progress, starting with that which has been accomplished individually. We then explain how all of our individual progress integrates more broadly into the entire scope of our project. Here, we highlight our successful outcomes as we work on completing our project. 

Second, we elaborate upon where we plan to take the project from the present moment. We discuss what has been accomplished, we explain where we stand currently in our progress, and we then plan the future of our wine quality analysis. We touch back on previously-established goals and formulate new goals for what we want to accomplish throughout our project.

Next, we ask questions to one another to discern how we will accomplish that which needs to be taken care of next. Here, we compile which tasks are to be completed. Then, we fairly distribute the workload amongst one another. We communicate clearly and record our plans in writing, taking notes as we coordinate.

Finally, we encourage one another to be excellent. We touch back on our project goals once more. We point out the positive qualities in one another in earnest, and elaborate upon how those qualities help to make the group work most productively and cohesively.

## Keeping Track of Tasks
The team will create a Google spreadsheet with tasks to complete throughout the project. Each row will indicate a task, with columns denoting how the task was completed, when it was completed, who completed it, and finally a column indicating that the other teammates have corroborated the success of the marked 'completed task'.

## Questions We Seek to Answer
We maintain a handful of questions we seek to answer once our analysis is thoroughly complete.

- Which features are most important in indicating quality of wine?
- What is our goal for our machine learning model's accuracy on the test data? If we can't reach this goal, what is the highest accuracy we can achieve?
- Which features do not play an important role in wine quality scoring?
- What model is best at predicting outcomes?
- *Why* is the model that is *best* at predicting outcomes the best at doing so?
