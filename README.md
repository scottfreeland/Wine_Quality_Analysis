# Wine_Quality_Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to indicate which features of wine are the most important in determining the quality of wine. Using a machine learning model, we aim to convey what it takes to create the highest-quality, most successful, and most marketable wine.

## Keeping Track of Tasks
The team will create a Google spreadsheet with tasks to complete throughout the project. Each row will indicate a task, with columns denoting how the task was completed, when it was completed, who completed it, and finally a column indicating that the other teammates have corroborated the success of the marked 'completed task'.

## Questions We Seek to Answer
We maintain a handful of questions we seek to answer once our analysis is thoroughly complete.

- Which features are most important in indicating quality of wine?
- What is our goal for our machine learning model's accuracy on the test data? If we can't reach this goal, what is the highest accuracy we can achieve?
- Which features do not play an important role in wine quality scoring?
- What model is best at predicting outcomes?
- *Why* is the model that is *best* at predicting outcomes the best at doing so?
